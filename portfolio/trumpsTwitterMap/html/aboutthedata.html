    <strong>Where is it from?</strong>
    <p>The original data was acquired from <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910%2FDVN%2FKJEBIL">Harvard's Dataverse.</a> The data was then processed using a python script to count the number of times each country was mentioned per year and saved the result to a csv file for use with the map.</p>
    <br>
    <strong>How was it processed?</strong>
    <p>Using the names of countries within the countries topojson file, each tweet was examined to see if each it contained each country name.  
        If a tweet contained two different country names, each country included would gain a mention.  Extra criteria for a mention was created speifically for the USA.  
        If a tweet contained the word "america" and did not contain "north", "south", or "united states of america", it was assumed that Trump was referring to 
        the USA and counted as a mention.  In the same vain, if "USA" or "U.S.A." was included in the tweet, it was counted as a mention. It is recognized that 
        this method can not accurately calculate the exact number of country mentions due to language nuances.  It is also recognized that country names change
        and the list generated from the 2018 Natural Earth countries topojson file may not include all country names mentioned.</p>
